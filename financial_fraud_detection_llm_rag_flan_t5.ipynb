        "This project leverages advanced AI technologies, including Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to identify and flag potential fraud in financial data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Large Language Models (LLM):\n",
        "LLMs are trained on vast amounts of textual data and can understand and generate human-like text. In fraud detection, LLMs can analyze financial statements, detect anomalies, and recognize patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\n",
        "RAG combines the capabilities of LLMs with a retrieval mechanism to enhance the generation process. It retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus and uses them to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses. In this context, RAG can pull relevant financial records, reports, and contextual data to assist in the detection and explanation of potential fraud.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Application:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Input:** Financial statements and related documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Process:** The system uses RAG to retrieve pertinent information from a database and employs LLM to analyze and interpret the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output:** A concise report indicating whether the financial statement exhibits fraudulent behavior, with an explanation based on the retrieved context.\n",
        "\n",
        "This combination of LLM and RAG enhances the accuracy and reliability of fraud detection in financial filings, making it a powerful tool for auditors, regulators, and financial institutions.\n",
