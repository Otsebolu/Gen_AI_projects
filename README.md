# Gen_AI_projects
Below is the description of the list of Generative AI/LLMs projects I recently worked on, in the month of Augsut 2024,  and pushed to Github.


1) AI-powered Bank Customer Service Assistant, based on Llama 3.0 model. This is the "Bank_customer_service.ipynb file".

I built an AI-powered assistant for customer service care in Retail Banking. It is an app that engages customers in conversational interactions. It automates routine tasks such as customer inquiries, complaints and account management, freeing up human resources to focus on higher-value activities. To validate this innovation, one of the top three big banks in Nigeria was used as a case study. My innovative solution was validated by comparing its performance versus that of the performance of the app used by the top bank for such similar customer service and care operations. I am a customer of this bank, hence I use the bank‚Äôs app. The bank‚Äôs app is a popular one around here, I have tested it, it is inefficient. I do not want to mention the name of the bank for obvious reasons.

2) AI-powered Social and Mental Health Counsellor/Therapist innovation, based on Llama 3.0 model. This is the "Social&Mental_Health_Solution.ipynb" file

Due to the high rate of social and mental health cases globally, getting access to qualified psychologists and counselling is sometimes challenging. To address this, I developed an innovative solution that allows conversations between the app, an AI-powered counsellor and you, the client. The app provides counselling and therapy to societal challenges, as well as mental health services/advice. 33 social and mental health topics such as üíë Relationships, üòü Anxiety, üòî Depression, ü§ó Intimacy, üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Family Conflict, and so on, are captured in the app.

3) AI-powered Health and Medical Access solution based on mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 model. This is the Medical_Patient_Assistant_(3).ipynb file
   
Getting access to a medical doctor is getting increasingly difficult and expensive in Nigeria today, coupled with exodus of doctors to abroad where they are paid better for theor services. Due to the high rates of deaths occurring daily, it is crucial now to make the right, medical information accessible to the public and patients. If people can get access to the same information used by doctors on time, some deaths could be averted. Hence this was why this project was done. The project involved automation of the reference book used by physicians and pharmacists globally. 
This solution is an AI-powered chatbot not meant to replace personal consultation with a qualified physician, pharmacist, or other health care professional, but to provide medical information for the general public especially the consumers. Basically, it offers professional medical information and knowledge on the following aspects of diseases :
- the causes of diseases, 
-the evaluation of diseases - how to know if you have a particular disease as in the signs and symptoms to watch out for, 
-the treatment medical doctors give their patients, as this knowledge can be used by the patients to help themselves (as in especially places where access to medical facility is challenging), before they can get the attention of a medical doctor. 
With the information provided via this app, people‚Äôs lives could be saved to a reasonable degree.

4) AI-powered Fraud Detection solution based on google/flan-t5-large model. This is the "financial_fraud_detection_llm_rag_flan_t5.ipynb" file
   
This solution focuses on helping organisations to detect fraud cases.
This solution when supplied with data of varying sources be it: historical, financial records, reports, or contextual data, can detect if such data or information is of fraudulent nature or not. This AI assistant can alert financial institutions when unusual activity occurs
